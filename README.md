# Coursera_Capstone
IBM Applied Data Science capstone project notebook

Main notebook is Coursera_Applied_DS_Capstone.ipynb.
To run notebook you will need your own Foursquare credentials.
The folium maps generated in the notebook tend to use up a good bit of memory pretty quickly so you may wish to clear outputs when moving on to other cells to avoid Jupyter from crashing.

The report file for the project is Coursera_Cap_Report.ipynb.
